The results from inference on the PrecursorCluster model are the set of peaks and their assignments to IP clusters through any of the predefined list of transformation (Fig.\nobreakspace  {}\ref  {fig:01}A). As a starting point, each observed peak feature generates a candidate IP cluster, having the cluster's mass computed through the M+H transformation of the observed peak's m/z value. In Fig.\nobreakspace  {}\ref  {fig:01}A, this results Peak 1 generating the candidate cluster with mass $q_a$ Peak 4 generating the candidate cluster with mass $q_b$ (other candidate IP clusters produced by Peak 2, 3 and 5 are not shown in the figure). As a result from inference, Peak 1 and Peak 2 are clustered to $q_a$ through the transformation types M+H and M+Na respectively with probability 1.0. Peak 3 has a valid transformation path to $q_a$, but it is not allowed to join that cluster since its intensity is greater than the intensity of the precursor peak. Peak 4 can either form a cluster with $q_a$ through the 2M+H transformation (with probability 0.62) or, through the M+H transformation on itself, form its own candidate IP cluster having the precursor mass $q_b$ (with probability 0.38.) The latter allows for Peak 5 to join that cluster too through the M+NH4 transformation with probability 0.43. For alignment, the final clustering result is established by taking the assignment that has the highest probability for each peak feature. Alignment of IP clusters can be performed by matching IP clusters according to their posterior precursor mass and RT values across runs (Fig.\nobreakspace  {}\ref  {fig:01}B) or by further clustering them into top-level clusters in a second-stage clustering process (Fig.\nobreakspace  {}\ref  {fig:01}C). The matching of peak features of IP clusters into the same top-level cluster is constructed by matching peak features that have the same transformation types together.

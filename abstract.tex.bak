In recent years, the large-scale, untargeted studies of compounds that serve as workers in the cell (proteins) and the by-products of essential life-sustaining chemical processes (metabolites) have provided insights into a wide array of fields, such as medical diagnostics, drug discovery, personalised medicine and many others. Measurements in such studies are routinely performed using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) instruments, resulting in a set of peaks having mass-to-charge, retention time (RT) and intensity values. Before further analysis is possible, the raw LC-MS data has to be processed in a data pre-preprocessing pipeline. In the alignment step of the pipeline, peaks from multiple LC-MS measurements have to be matched. In the identification step, the identity of compounds that generate the observed peaks have to be assigned. Using tandem mass spectrometry, fragmentation peaks characteristic to a compound can be obtained and used to help establish the identity of the compound. Alignment and identification are challenging because the true identities of the entire set of compounds in the sample are unknown, and a single compound can produce many observed peaks, each with a potential drift in its retention time value. However, observed peaks are not independent --- there exists structural dependencies among the observed peaks as multiple peaks are related through being attributed to the same underlying compound. 

The aim of this thesis is to introduce methods in which related peaks can be grouped and to use these groupings to improve alignment and assist in identification. Firstly, we introduce a generative model to group related peaks by their retention time and use this information to influence direct-matching alignment, bringing related peak groups closer during matching. Investigations using benchmark datasets shows that this approach produces a better alignment result (Chapter~\ref{c:matching}). Secondly, we consider mass information and introduce a model that performs the grouping of related peaks in the same LC-MS run by explainable mass relationships, RT and intensity. Through a second-stage matching process, the resulting groups from the model can be used to produce better alignment results on benchmark metabolomics datasets, In addition, uncertainties in matched peaksets can also be extracted from the model (Chapter~\ref{c:precursor-clustering}). Next, we improve upon the two-stage process described before and introduce a model that performs the flexible clustering of related peaks within and across multiple LC-MS runs at once, allowing for the matching of peaks and their respective uncertainties to be naturally extracted from the model (Chapter~\ref{c:hdp}). Finally, we look at fragmentation data and introduce the application of topic modelling to model groups of related fragmentation peaks that potentially correspond to substructures shared by metabolites (Chapter~\ref{c:lda}). This final section corresponds to work in progress and points to many interesting avenues for future research.

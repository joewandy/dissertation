Firstly, I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisor, Simon Rogers, for his invaluable advices, insightful discussions and the time he spent proofreading my writing and catching my many `typographaphical errors'. I would also like to thank Alice Miller for her guidance. I have also benefited from collaborations with others --- in particular, Ronan Daly, Justin jjvd. Hooft, Karl Burgess, Yoann Gloaguen, Naomi Rankin, alongside other staff at Glasgow Polyomics.

I would also like to show my appreciation to SICSA for funding my PhD and also everyone from the IDI group, in particular Rod for running the group so seamlessly and those I have shared my office space with, in no particular order they are: Faiz, Shimin, Colin, Tommi, Daryl, George, Xiaoyu, Antoine. 

And finally I would like to thank my family for their continuous support and encouragement.

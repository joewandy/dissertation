This thesis would not have existed without the support of everybody whom I have come in contact over the past years. In particular, I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisor, Simon Rogers, for his encouragements and insightful discussions. I would also like to thank Alice Miller and David Leader for their guidance. I have also benefited from collaborations with others --- in particular, Ronan Daly, Justin jjvd. Hooft, Karl Burgess, Yoann Gloaguen, Naomi Rankin. Other staff at Glasgow Polyomics also provide useful distractions, such as Pawel, Mani, Gavin, Graham, Julian, Galaxy David, Stefan, etc.

I would also like to show my appreciation to everyone from the IDI group, in particular those I have shared my office space with, in no particular order they are: Faiz, Shimin, Colin, Tommi, Daryl, Lorna, George, Xiaoyu, Antoine. 

And finally I would like to thank my family for their continuous support and encouragement.

This thesis would not have existed without the support of everybody whom I have come in contact over the past years. In particular, I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisor, Simon Rogers, for his encouragements and insightful discussions. I would also like to thank Alice Miller for her guidance. I have also benefited from collaborations with others --- in particular, Ronan Daly, Justin jjvd. Hooft, Karl Burgess, Yoann Gloaguen, Naomi Rankin, alongside other staff at Glasgow Polyomics.

I would also like to show my appreciation to everyone from the IDI group, in particular those I have shared my office space with, in no particular order they are: Faiz, Shimin, Colin, Tommi, Daryl, Lorna, George, Xiaoyu, Antoine. 

And finally I would like to thank my family for their continuous support and encouragement.

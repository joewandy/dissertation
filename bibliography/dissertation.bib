@article{Allen2014,
abstract = {Motivation: Electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) is commonly used in high-throughput metabolomics. However, one of the key obstacles to the effective use of this technology is the difficulty in processing measured spectra to accurately and efficiently identify metabolites. Traditional methods for automated metabolite identification compare a target MS or MS/MS spectrum to spectra in a reference database, ranking likely candidates as those with the closest match. However the limited coverage of available databases has led to interest in computational methods for predicting reference MS/MS spectra from chemical structures. This work proposes a probabilistic generative model for the MS/MS fragmentation process, which we call Competitive Fragmentation Modeling (CFM), and a machine learning approach for learning parameters for this model from data. We show that CFM can be used in both a MS/MS spectrum prediction task (ie, predicting the mass spectrum from a chemical structure), and in a metabolite identification task (ranking possible structures for a target MS/MS spectrum). Results: In the MS/MS spectrum prediction task, this method shows significantly improved Jaccard scores when compared to a full enumeration of all peaks corresponding to substructures of the molecule. In the metabolite identification task, CFM obtains substantially better rankings for the correct candidate than existing methods MetFrag and FingerID, on a collection of 1985 tripeptides and 1491 non-peptide metabolites, querying PubChem for candidate structures of the same mass. Availability: Windows executables and cross-platform source code are freely available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/cfm-id. Supplementary files containing test molecule lists and trained models are also available on that site.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new method for efficiently calculating the exact masses in an isotopic distribution using a dynamic programming approach. The resulting program, isoDalton, can generate extremely high isotopic resolutions as demonstrated by a FWHM resolution of 2 x 10(11). This resolution allows very fine mass structures in isotopic distributions to be seen, even for large molecules. Since the number of exact masses grows exponentially with molecular size, only the most probable exact masses are kept, the number of which is user specified.},

@article{DaSilva2015,
abstract = {Extract Despite the over 100-y history of mass spectrometry, it remains challenging to link the large volume of known chemical structures to the data obtained with mass spectrometers. Presently, only 1.8{\%} of spectra in an untargeted metabolomics experiment can be annotated. This means that the vast majority of information collected by metabolomics is “dark matter,” chemical signatures that remain uncharacterized (Fig. 1). For a genomic comparison, 80{\%} of predicted genes in the Escherichia coli genome are known. In a bacteriophage metagenome, a well-known frontier of biological dark matter, the amount of known genes is 1–30{\%}, depending on the sample (1). Thus, one could argue that we know more about the genetics of uncultured phage than we do about the chemistry within our own bodies. Much of the chemical dark matter may include known structures, but they remain undiscovered because the reference spectra are not available in mass spectrometry databases. The only way to overcome this challenge is through the development of computational solutions. In PNAS, D{\"{u}}hrkop et al. describe the development of such a computational tool, called CSI (compound structure identification):FingerID (2). The tool is designed to aid in the annotation of chemistries that can be observed by mass spectrometry. CSI:FingerID uses fragmentation trees to connect tandem MS (MS/MS) data to chemical structures found in public chemistry databases. Tools such as this can allow metabolomics with mass spectrometry to become as commonly used and scientifically productive as sequencing technologies have in the field of genomics.},

abstract = {In this paper the performance of three alignment algorithms, correlation optimized warping, parametric time warping and semi-parametric time warping, is compared on real chromatograms. Among these, parametric time warping is the simplest and fastest; generally less than 1s is required to align two chromatograms. It does not require the optimization of input parameters and allows the alignment of peak shifts in only one direction, or non-complex peak shifts in both directions. With correlation optimized warping and semi-parametric time warping complex peak shifts in both directions can be corrected but at the expense of the optimization of two input parameters. Semi-parametric time warping requires the selection of the proper number of B-splines in the warping function and, if necessary, the optimization of the penalty parameter. Often the default values can be used to obtain aligned signals. The optimization of the input parameters for correlation optimized warping (section length, slack) is not easy and time-consuming. Moreover, dependent on the input parameters, the computation time of the correlation optimized warping algorithm can be twice as long as for semi-parametric time warping for which computation times up to 23 s are required. However, the performance of both algorithms is equally good considering the improvement of the precision of the peak retention times and correlation coefficients between the chromatograms, after alignment. For the data aligned in this study, the average retention time precision and the lowest correlation before warping were 14 and 0.17, and were improved to three and 0.83, and six and 0.87 after warping, with correlation optimized warping and semi-parametric time warping, respectively.},

abstract = {Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with metabolomics data linked genetic variation in the human genome to differences in individual metabolite levels. A strong relevance of this metabolic individuality for biomedical and pharmaceutical research has been reported. However, a considerable amount of the molecules currently quantified by modern metabolomics techniques are chemically unidentified. The identification of these "unknown metabolites" is still a demanding and intricate task, limiting their usability as functional markers of metabolic processes. As a consequence, previous GWAS largely ignored unknown metabolites as metabolic traits for the analysis. Here we present a systems-level approach that combines genome-wide association analysis and Gaussian graphical modeling with metabolomics to predict the identity of the unknown metabolites. We apply our method to original data of 517 metabolic traits, of which 225 are unknowns, and genotyping information on 655,658 genetic variants, measured in 1,768 human blood samples. We report previously undescribed genotype-metabotype associations for six distinct gene loci (SLC22A2, COMT, CYP3A5, CYP2C18, GBA3, UGT3A1) and one locus not related to any known gene (rs12413935). Overlaying the inferred genetic associations, metabolic networks, and knowledge-based pathway information, we derive testable hypotheses on the biochemical identities of 106 unknown metabolites. As a proof of principle, we experimentally confirm nine concrete predictions. We demonstrate the benefit of our method for the functional interpretation of previous metabolomics biomarker studies on liver detoxification, hypertension, and insulin resistance. Our approach is generic in nature and can be directly transferred to metabolomics data from different experimental platforms.},

However, flexible integration of these methods into configurations best suited to the research question is hampered by heterogeneous file formats and monolithic software development. The mzXML, mzData, and mzML file formats have enabled uniform access to unprocessed raw data. In this paper we present our efforts to produce an equally simple and powerful format, PeakML, to uniformly exchange processed intermediary and result data. To demonstrate the versatility of PeakML, we have developed an open source Java toolkit for processing, filtering, and annotating mass spectra in a customizable pipeline (mzMatch), as well as a user-friendly data visualization environment (PeakML Viewer). The PeakML format in particular enables the flexible exchange of processed data between software created by different groups or companies, as we illustrate by providing a PeakML-based integration of the widely used XCMS package with mzMatch data processing tools. As an added advantage, downstream analysis can benefit from direct access to the full mass trace information underlying summarized mass spectrometry results, providing the user with the means to rapidly verify results. The PeakML/mzMatch software is freely available at http://mzmatch.sourceforge.net, with documentation, tutorials, and a community forum.},

The problems of finding the dendrogram tree cutoff which gives the optimal number of peak clusters and the effect of different clustering methods were addressed.

abstract = {We characterize pairwise and multiple sequence alignment (MSA) errors by comparing true alignments from simulations of sequence evolution with reconstructed alignments. The vast majority of reconstructed alignments contain many errors. Error rates rapidly increase with sequence divergence, thus, for even intermediate degrees of sequence divergence, more than half of the columns of a reconstructed alignment may be expected to be erroneous. In closely related sequences, most errors consist of the erroneous positioning of a single indel event and their effect is local. As sequences diverge, errors become more complex as a result of the simultaneous mis-reconstruction of many indel events, and the lengths of the affected MSA segments increase dramatically. We found a systematic bias towards underestimation of the number of gaps, which leads to the reconstructed MSA being on average shorter than the true one. Alignment errors are unavoidable even when the evolutionary parameters are known in advance. Correct reconstruction can only be guaranteed when the likelihood of true alignment is uniquely optimal. However, true alignment features are very frequently sub-optimal or co-optimal, with the result that optimal albeit erroneous features are incorporated into the reconstructed MSA. Progressive MSA utilizes a guide-tree in the reconstruction of MSAs. The quality of the guide-tree was found to affect MSA error levels only marginally.},

Firstly, individual weights are assigned to each sequence in a partial alignment in order to down-weight near-duplicate sequences and up-weight the most divergent ones. Secondly, amino acid substitution matrices are varied at different alignment stages according to the divergence of the sequences to be aligned. Thirdly, residue-specific gap penalties and locally reduced gap penalties in hydrophilic regions encourage new gaps in potential loop regions rather than regular secondary structure. Fourthly, positions in early alignments where gaps have been opened receive locally reduced gap penalties to encourage the opening up of new gaps at these positions. These modifications are incorporated into a new program, CLUSTAL W which is freely available.},

abstract = {We describe a new method (T-Coffee) for multiple sequence alignment that provides a dramatic improvement in accuracy with a modest sacrifice in speed as compared to the most commonly used alternatives. The method is broadly based on the popular progressive approach to multiple alignment but avoids the most serious pitfalls caused by the greedy nature of this algorithm. With T-Coffee we pre-process a data set of all pair-wise alignments between the sequences. This provides us with a library of alignment information that can be used to guide the progressive alignment. Intermediate alignments are then based not only on the sequences to be aligned next but also on how all of the sequences align with each other. This alignment information can be derived from heterogeneous sources such as a mixture of alignment programs and/or structure superposition. Here, we illustrate the power of the approach by using a combination of local and global pair-wise alignments to generate the library. The resulting alignments are significantly more reliable, as determined by comparison with a set of 141 test cases, than any of the popular alternatives that we tried. The improvement, especially clear with the more difficult test cases, is always visible, regardless of the phylogenetic spread of the sequences in the tests.},

@article{Penn2010,
abstract = {Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is the basis for a wide range of comparative sequence analyses from molecular phylogenetics to 3D structure prediction. Sophisticated algorithms have been developed for sequence alignment, but in practice, many errors can be expected and extensive portions of the MSA are unreliable. Hence, it is imperative to understand and characterize the various sources of errors in MSAs and to quantify site-specific alignment confidence. In this paper, we show that uncertainties in the guide tree used by progressive alignment methods are a major source of alignment uncertainty. We use this insight to develop a novel method for quantifying the robustness of each alignment column to guide tree uncertainty. We build on the widely used bootstrap method for perturbing the phylogenetic tree. Specifically, we generate a collection of trees and use each as a guide tree in the alignment algorithm, thus producing a set of MSAs. We next test the consistency of every column of the MSA obtained from the unperturbed guide tree with respect to the set of MSAs. We name this measure the "GUIDe tree based AligNment ConfidencE" (GUIDANCE) score. Using the Benchmark Alignment data BASE benchmark as well as simulation studies, we show that GUIDANCE scores accurately identify errors in MSAs. Additionally, we compare our results with the previously published Heads-or-Tails score and show that the GUIDANCE score is a better predictor of unreliably aligned regions.},

abstract = {We describe a novel model and algorithm for simultaneously estimating multiple molecular sequence alignments and the phylogenetic trees that relate the sequences. Unlike current techniques that base phylogeny estimates on a single estimate of the alignment, we take alignment uncertainty into account by considering all possible alignments. Furthermore, because the alignment and phylogeny are constructed simultaneously, a guide tree is not needed. This sidesteps the problem in which alignments created by progressive alignment are biased toward the guide tree used to generate them. Joint estimation also allows us to model rate variation between sites when estimating the alignment and to use the evidence in shared insertion/deletions (indels) to group sister taxa in the phylogeny. Our indel model makes use of affine gap penalties and considers indels of multiple letters. We make the simplifying assumption that the indel process is identical on all branches. As a result, the probability of a gap is independent of branch length. We use a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to sample from the posterior of the joint model, estimating the most probable alignment and tree and their support simultaneously. We describe a new MCMC transition kernel that improves our algorithm's mixing efficiency, allowing the MCMC chains to converge even when started from arbitrary alignments. Our software implementation can estimate alignment uncertainty and we describe a method for summarizing this uncertainty in a single plot.},

abstract = {We describe a new program for the alignment of multiple biological sequences that is both statistically motivated and fast enough for problem sizes that arise in practice. Our Fast Statistical Alignment program is based on pair hidden Markov models which approximate an insertion/deletion process on a tree and uses a sequence annealing algorithm to combine the posterior probabilities estimated from these models into a multiple alignment. FSA uses its explicit statistical model to produce multiple alignments which are accompanied by estimates of the alignment accuracy and uncertainty for every column and character of the alignment--previously available only with alignment programs which use computationally-expensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo approaches--yet can align thousands of long sequences. Moreover, FSA utilizes an unsupervised query-specific learning procedure for parameter estimation which leads to improved accuracy on benchmark reference alignments in comparison to existing programs. The centroid alignment approach taken by FSA, in combination with its learning procedure, drastically reduces the amount of false-positive alignment on biological data in comparison to that given by other methods. The FSA program and a companion visualization tool for exploring uncertainty in alignments can be used via a web interface at http://orangutan.math.berkeley.edu/fsa/, and the source code is available at http://fsa.sourceforge.net/.},

Here we describe a software package, Metabolomic Analysis and Visualization ENgine (MAVEN), designed for efficient interactive analysis of {LC}-{MS} data, including in the presence of isotope labeling. The software contains tools for all aspects of the data analysis process, from feature extraction to pathway-based graphical data display. To facilitate data validation, a machine learning algorithm automatically assesses peak quality. Users interact with raw data primarily in the form of extracted ion chromatograms, which are displayed with overlaid circles indicating peak quality, and bar graphs of peak intensities for both unlabeled and isotope-labeled metabolite forms. Click-based navigation leads to additional information, such as raw data for specific isotopic forms or for metabolites changing significantly between conditions. Fast data processing algorithms result in nearly delay-free browsing. Drop-down menus provide tools for the overlay of data onto pathway maps. These tools enable animating series of pathway graphs, e.g., to show propagation of labeled forms through a metabolic network.

@article{Brodsky2010,
abstract = {The output of {LC}-{MS} metabolomics experiments consists of mass-peak intensities identified through a peak-picking/alignment procedure. Besides imperfections in biological samples and instrumentation, data accuracy is highly dependent on the applied algorithms and their parameters. Consequently, quality control (QC) is essential for further data analysis. Here, we present a QC approach that is based on discrepancies between replicate samples. First, the quantile normalization of per-sample log-signal distributions is applied to each group of biologically homogeneous samples. Next, the overall quality of each replicate group is characterized by the Z-transformed correlation coefficients between samples. This general QC allows a tuning of the procedure's parameters which minimizes the inter-replicate discrepancies in the generated output. Subsequently, an in-depth QC measure detects local neighborhoods on a template of aligned chromatograms that are enriched by divergences between intensity profiles of replicate samples. These neighborhoods are determined through a segmentation algorithm. The retention time (RT)-m/z positions of the neighborhoods with local divergences are indicative of either: incorrect alignment of chromatographic features, technical problems in the chromatograms, or to a true biological discrepancy between replicates for particular metabolites. We expect this method to aid in the accurate analysis of metabolomics data and in the development of new peak-picking/alignment procedures.},

However, there is still much experimental variation to be controlled including both within-experiment and between-experiment variation. For efficient analysis, an ideal peak alignment method to deal with such variations is in great need. RESULTS: Using experimental data of a mixture of metabolite standards, we demonstrated that our method has better performance than other existing method which is not model-based. We then applied our method to the data generated from the plasma of a rat, which also demonstrates good performance of our model. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a model-based peak alignment method to process both homogeneous and heterogeneous experimental data. The unique feature of our method is the only model-based peak alignment method coupled with metabolite identification in an unified framework. Through the comparison with other existing method, we demonstrated that our method has better performance.

@article{GhanatBari2014b,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: In liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/tandem mass spectrometry ({LC}-{MS}/MS), it is necessary to link tandem MS-identified peptide peaks so that protein expression changes between the two runs can be tracked. However, only a small number of peptides can be identified and linked by tandem MS in two runs, and it becomes necessary to link peptide peaks with tandem identification in one run to their corresponding ones in another run without identification. In the past, peptide peaks are linked based on similarities in retention time (rt), mass or peak shape after rt alignment, which corrects mean rt shifts between runs. However, the accuracy in linking is still limited especially for complex samples collected from different conditions. Consequently, large-scale proteomics studies that require comparison of protein expression profiles of hundreds of patients can not be carried out effectively. METHOD: In this article, we consider the problem of linking peptides from a pair of {LC}-{MS}/MS runs and propose a new method, PeakLink (PL), which uses information in both the time and frequency domain as inputs to a non-linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The PL algorithm first uses a threshold on an rt likelihood ratio score to remove candidate corresponding peaks with excessively large elution time shifts, then PL calculates the correlation between a pair of candidate peaks after reducing noise through wavelet transformation. After converting rt and peak shape correlation to statistical scores, an SVM classifier is trained and applied for differentiating corresponding and non-corresponding peptide peaks. RESULTS: PL is tested in multiple challenging cases, in which {LC}-{MS}/MS samples are collected from different disease states, different instruments and different laboratories. Testing results show significant improvement in linking accuracy compared with other algorithms. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: M files for the PL alignment method are available at http://compgenomics.utsa.edu/zgroup/PeakLink CONTACT: Michelle.Zhang@utsa.edu SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Databases require good quality spectra with sufficient compound information, but processing, calibration, noise reduction and retrieval of compound information are time-consuming tasks that prevent many contributions. We present a comprehensive workflow for the automatic processing of MS/MS using formula annotation for recalibration and cleanup to generate high quality spectra of standard compounds for upload to MassBank (www.massbank.jp). Compound information is retrieved via Internet services. Reference standards of 70 pesticides were measured at various collision energies on an LTQ-Orbitrap XL to develop and evaluate the workflow. A total of 944 resulting spectra are now available on MassBank. Evidence of nitrogen adduct formation during MS/MS fragmentation processes was found, highlighting the benefits high accuracy MS/MS offers for spectral interpretation. A database of recalibrated, cleaned-up spectra resulted in the most correct spectra ranked in first place, regardless of whether the search spectra were recalibrated or not, whereas the average rank of the correct molecular formula was improved from 2.55 (uncalibrated) to 1.53 when using recalibrated MS/MS data. The workflow is available as an R package RMassBank capable of generating MassBank records from raw MS and MS/MS data and can be adjusted to process data acquired with different settings and instruments. This workflow is a vital step towards addressing the need for more high quality, high accuracy MS/MS spectra in spectral databases and provides important information for spectral interpretation.},

abstract = {Identification of metabolites is a major challenge in biological studies and relies in principle on mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods. The increased sensitivity and stability of both NMR and MS systems have made dereplication of complex biological samples feasible. Metabolic databases can be of help in the identification process. Nonetheless, there is still a lack of adequate spectral databases that contain high quality spectra, but new developments in this area will assist in the (semi-)automated identification process in the near future. Here, we discuss new developments for the structural elucidation of low abundant metabolites present in complex sample matrices. We describe how a recently developed combination of high resolution MS multistage fragmentation (MSn) and high resolution one dimensional (1D)-proton (1H)-NMR of liquid chromatography coupled to solid phase extraction (LC-SPE) purified metabolites can circumvent the need for isolating extensive amounts of the compounds of interest to elucidate their structures. The {LC}-{MS}-SPE-NMR hardware configuration in conjunction with high quality databases facilitates complete structural elucidation of metabolites even at sub-microgram levels of compound in crude extracts. However, progress is still required to optimally exploit the power of an integrated MS and NMR approach. Especially, there is a need to improve and expand both MSn and NMR spectral databases. Adequate and user-friendly software is required to assist in candidate selection based on the comparison of acquired MS and NMR spectral information with reference data. It is foreseen that these focal points will contribute to a better transfer and exploitation of structural information gained from diverse analytical platforms. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

We present a new label-free data analysis workflow integrated into a multiuser software platform. A novel adaptive alignment algorithm has been developed to minimize the possible systematic bias introduced into the analysis. Parameters are estimated on the fly from the data at hand, producing a user-friendly analysis suite. Quality metrics are output in every step of the analysis as well as actively incorporated into the parameter estimation. We furthermore show the improvement of this system by comprehensive comparison to classical label-free analysis methodology as well as current state-of-the-art software.},

abstract = {A first step in identifying the content of a document is determining which topics that document addresses. We describe a generative model for documents, introduced by Blei, Ng, and Jordan [Blei, D. M., Ng, A. Y. {\&} Jordan, M. I. (2003) J. Machine Learn. Res. 3, 993-1022], in which each document is generated by choosing a distribution over topics and then choosing each word in the document from a topic selected according to this distribution. We then present a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for inference in this model. We use this algorithm to analyze abstracts from PNAS by using Bayesian model selection to establish the number of topics. We show that the extracted topics capture meaningful structure in the data, consistent with the class designations provided by the authors of the articles, and outline further applications of this analysis, including identifying "hot topics" by examining temporal dynamics and tagging abstracts to illustrate semantic content.},
